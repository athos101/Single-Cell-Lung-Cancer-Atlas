# Single-Cell-Lung-Cancer-Atlas
## This project aims to build a single-cell lung atlas with emphasis in lung cancer, by building pipelines in a python environment.

The project goals:
  * Integraring several curated samples from papers
  * Processing and analysing the samples
  * Defining good markers to annotate the cell identities
  * Defining a detailed pipeline for the annotation and differential expression analysis
  * Defining a compositional analysis pipeline

The repository contains the following python notebooks:
  * 'Dataset Preparation'.ipynb - integrate and process the datasets.
  * 'Annotation Atlas'.ipynb - annotation of the 3 levels of cell identities.

Important libraries used:
  * Scanpy, for the anndata functions, from reading/writing single-cell files, plotting useful graphs, processing clusters and more.
  * scVI, to integrate data, remove doublets and calculate optimal parameters for dataset processing, as well as marker ranking, all using machine learning models.

What datasets were used:
  * I'll do it later, im too lazy for now (=✖ ᆺ ✖=)

How to install the pipeline:
